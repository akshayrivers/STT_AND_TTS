Speech to text and Text to Speech in Node js
For now I am exploring two different options:
1. **Google Cloud Speech to Text and Text to Speech**
- High accuracy and low latency 
- Paid service
2. **Mozilla DeepSpeech**
- because open source and can run locally
- accuracy is not as good as Google Cloud Speech to Text
